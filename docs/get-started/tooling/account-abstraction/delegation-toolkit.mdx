The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is a collection of tools for integrating embedded smart contract 
wallets, known as MetaMask smart accounts, into dapps. These smart accounts allow users to delegate
specific permissions, such as spending limits or time-based access, to other accounts.

The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit supports two types of smart accounts, each offering unique features
and use cases.

## Hybrid smart account

The Hybrid smart account is a flexible implementation that supports both an externally 
owned account (EOA) "owner" and any number of P256 (passkey) signers. 
See [Hybrid smart account](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/how-to/create-smart-account/configure-accounts-signers/#configure-a-hybrid-smart-account) for more information.

## Multisig smart account

The Multisig smart account is an implementation that supports multiple signers with a configurable threshold 
for valid signatures, allowing for enhanced security and flexibility in account management. 
See [Multisig smart account](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/how-to/create-smart-account/configure-accounts-signers/#configure-a-multisig-smart-account) for more information.
